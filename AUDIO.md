# Audio Files

This project requires some audio files for the player to work properly.  
Due to size limits, audio files are **not included** in this repository.

## How to add audio files

1. Create a folder named `audio` in the root directory of the project.
2. Add your `.mp3` or `.wav` files into the `audio` folder.
3. The app will automatically load and list all the audio files from that folder.
